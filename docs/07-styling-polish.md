## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you've completed the previous section or are up to date with the `checkpoint-06-game-over` branch.

**To get up to speed:**

1. **Switch to the branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout checkpoint-06-game-over
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Exercise 1: Install `react-confetti`

To add celebratory effects, we will use the `react-confetti` package to show confetti when the player wins the game.

**Instructions:**

- Run the following command to install the dependency:

  ```bash
  yarn add react-confetti
  ```

---

## Exercise 2: Enhance the Game Board

You'll improve the appearance of your game board to make it more engaging for users.

### Changes:

- Increased the size of each slot in the game board for better visibility.
- Added vibrant colors to provide clear feedback when a guess is correct, partially correct, or incorrect.

```typescript
// src/components/guess-item.tsx

"use client";

import { cn } from "~/lib/utils"; // Helper function to conditionally combine class names
import { type api } from "~/server/api";

import { InputOTP, InputOTPGroup, InputOTPSlot } from "./ui/input-otp";

type GuessItemProps = {
  guess: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof api.guesses.findByGameId>>[number];
};

function GuessItemSlot({ index, result }: { index: number; result: string }) {
  return (
    <InputOTPSlot
      index={index}
      className={cn(
        // Updated the size of the slots for better visibility
        "h-16 w-16 border-none text-3xl font-medium uppercase first:rounded-l-none last:rounded-r-none",
        {
          // Updated colors for incorrect (X), correct (C), and partially correct (~) letters
          "bg-red-500 text-red-50": result === "X", // Incorrect letter, red background
          "bg-green-500 text-green-50": result === "C", // Correct letter, green background
          "bg-yellow-500 text-yellow-50": result === "~", // Partially correct, yellow background
        }
      )}
    />
  );
}

// Updated the GuessItem component to reflect the styling of each guess
export const GuessItem = ({ guess }: GuessItemProps) => {
  return (
    <InputOTP readOnly maxLength={5} value={guess.guess}>
      <InputOTPGroup className="gap-2">
        {[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].map((index) => (
          <GuessItemSlot
            key={index}
            index={index}
            result={guess.result[index] ?? ""}
          />
        ))}
      </InputOTPGroup>
    </InputOTP>
  );
};
```

---

## Exercise 3: Improve the Guess Input

In this exercise, you'll enhance the appearance of the guess input field to match the game board's updated styling.

### Changes:

- Reused the `GuessItemSlot` styling from the game board for consistency.
- Styled the guess input to ensure the size and appearance matches the game board.

```typescript
// src/components/guess-input.tsx

"use client";

import { REGEXP_ONLY_CHARS } from "input-otp";

import { useCreateGuess } from "~/lib/hooks/use-create-guess"; // Hook to handle submitting guesses
import { useGuess } from "~/lib/hooks/use-guess"; // Hook to track the current guess state

import { InputOTP, InputOTPGroup, InputOTPSlot } from "./ui/input-otp";

type GuessInputProps = {
  gameId: number;
};

// Reused the styling of GuessItemSlot from the game board for consistent appearance
function GuessItemSlot({ index }: { index: number }) {
  return (
    <InputOTPSlot
      index={index}
      className="h-16 w-16 border text-3xl font-medium uppercase first:rounded-l-none last:rounded-r-none"
    />
  );
}

// Styled GuessInput component to align with the game board
export const GuessInput = ({ gameId }: GuessInputProps) => {
  const { guess, setGuess } = useGuess();

  const createGuess = useCreateGuess();

  return (
    <InputOTP
      maxLength={5}
      pattern={REGEXP_ONLY_CHARS} // Ensures only valid characters are allowed
      value={guess}
      onChange={(value) => setGuess(value)} // Updates the guess state as user types
      onKeyDown={async (e) => {
        if (e.key === "Enter") {
          await createGuess(guess, gameId); // Submits the guess when Enter is pressed
        }
      }}
    >
      <InputOTPGroup className="gap-2">
        {[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].map((index) => (
          <GuessItemSlot key={index} index={index} />
        ))}
      </InputOTPGroup>
    </InputOTP>
  );
};
```

## Exercise 4: Create an Engaging Game Over Dialog

Youâ€™ll replace the simple game results display with a more engaging modal dialog, including confetti animations for a win.

### Changes:

- Added `react-confetti` for celebratory effects when the player wins.
- Created a modal dialog that displays the final game results (win/lose) along with all the guesses.
- Used the `Dialog` component for a clean and engaging interface.

```typescript
// src/components/game-results-dialog.tsx

"use client";

import { useCreateGame } from "~/lib/hooks/use-create-game"; // Hook to reset and create a new game
import { type api } from "~/server/api";
import { type games } from "~/server/db/schema";

import Confetti from "react-confetti"; // Used for win celebration
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "./ui/dialog"; // Modal dialog components
import { GuessItem } from "./guess-item"; // Reuse GuessItem component to display guesses
import { Button } from "./ui/button"; // Reusable button component

type GameResultsDialogProps = {
  status: (typeof games.status.enumValues)[number]; // The current game status
  guesses: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof api.guesses.findByGameId>>; // List of guesses for the current game
};

// Modal dialog to display game results with confetti on win
export const GameResultsDialog = ({
  status,
  guesses,
}: GameResultsDialogProps) => {
  const createGame = useCreateGame(); // Function to create a new game when user clicks "Play again"

  if (status === "in_progress") return null; // Don't show dialog if the game is still ongoing

  return (
    <Dialog open={true}>
      <DialogContent className="flex flex-col items-center gap-6 rounded-2xl p-12 md:max-w-fit">
        {status === "won" ? (
          <>
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-6">
              <div className="text-center">
                <div className="text-7xl font-bold">you are</div>
                <div className="text-7xl font-bold text-green-500">
                  awesome!
                </div>
              </div>
              {/* Show the confetti animation when the player wins */}
              {guesses.map((guess) => (
                <GuessItem key={guess.id} guess={guess} />
              ))}
            </div>
            <Confetti
              className="h-full w-full"
              numberOfPieces={200} // Number of confetti pieces
              gravity={0.05} // Slow falling confetti effect
            />
          </>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-6">
            <div className="text-center">
              <div className="text-7xl font-bold">better luck</div>
              <div className="text-7xl font-bold text-red-500">next time!</div>
            </div>
            {guesses.map((guess) => (
              <GuessItem key={guess.id} guess={guess} />
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
        <Button
          variant="outline"
          className="h-14 w-full rounded-xl text-xl font-semibold"
          size="lg"
          onClick={() => createGame()} // Allows the user to play again
        >
          Play again!
        </Button>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
```

## Exercise 5: Update the `GameBoard` Component

Now you'll modify the `GameBoard` component to use the new `GameResultsDialog` for displaying game over messages.

### Changes:

- Replaced the old `GameResults` component with the new `GameResultsDialog`.
- Passed the `status` and `guesses` props to the `GameResultsDialog`.

```typescript
// src/components/game-board.tsx

import { type api } from "~/server/api";
import { type games } from "~/server/db/schema";

import { GameResultsDialog } from "./game-results-dialog"; // Import the new GameResultsDialog component
import { GuessInput } from "./guess-input";
import { GuessList } from "./guess-list";

type GameBoardProps = {
  gameId: number;
  status: (typeof games.status.enumValues)[number]; // Game status (in progress, won, lost)
  guesses: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof api.guesses.findByGameId>>; // All guesses for the current game
};

// Updated the GameBoard component to include GameResultsDialog for game-over feedback
export const GameBoard = ({ gameId, status, guesses }: GameBoardProps) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex grow flex-col items-center gap-6">
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        {/* Display the list of guesses */}
        <GuessList guesses={guesses} />
        {/* Only show GuessInput if the game is still in progress */}
        {status === "in_progress" && <GuessInput gameId={gameId} />}
      </div>
      {/* Include the new GameResultsDialog to show results and confetti for wins */}
      <GameResultsDialog status={status} guesses={guesses} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Exercise 6: Refine the On-Screen Keyboard

Finally, you'll improve the styling of the on-screen keyboard for a more polished look.

### Changes:

- Updated the keyboard layout and button styling for better interaction.
- Adjusted the size and theme of the keys to be more responsive.

```typescript
// src/components/guess-keyboard.tsx

"use client";

import "react-simple-keyboard/build/css/index.css"; // Importing CSS for the virtual keyboard

import Keyboard from "react-simple-keyboard";

import { useCreateGuess } from "~/lib/hooks/use-create-guess"; // Hook to handle creating guesses
import { useGuess } from "~/lib/hooks/use-guess"; // Hook to track the user's current guess

type GuessKeyboardProps = {
  gameId: number;
};

// Updated styling for a more user-friendly and polished keyboard
export const GuessKeyboard = ({ gameId }: GuessKeyboardProps) => {
  const { guess, setGuess } = useGuess();

  const createGuess = useCreateGuess();

  return (
    <Keyboard
      theme="hg-theme-default !bg-secondary/75" // Applied custom theme to the keyboard
      buttonTheme={[
        {
          class:
            "!bg-background !text-foreground !border-none !shadow-none hover:!bg-secondary/50 active:!bg-white/25 !h-16",
          buttons:
            "Q W E R T Y U I O P A S D F G H J K L Z X C V B N M {delete} {enter}",
        },
      ]}
      layout={{
        default: [
          "Q W E R T Y U I O P {delete}", // Added a row for the delete key
          "A S D F G H J K L {enter}", // Added a row for the enter key
          "Z X C V B N M", // Arranged the bottom row for letters
        ],
      }}
      onKeyPress={async (input) => {
        if (input === "{delete}") {
          setGuess(guess.slice(0, -1)); // Remove the last letter on delete press
          return;
        }

        if (input === "{enter}") {
          await createGuess(guess, gameId); // Submit the guess when enter is pressed
          return;
        }

        if (guess.length === 5) return; // Prevent further input after 5 characters

        setGuess(guess + input); // Add the pressed key to the guess
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## Checking Your Progress

Now that you've implemented these styling and polish improvements, it's time to test your application.

**Instructions:**

1. **Start the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Game:**

   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Start a new game by clicking the "New game" button.

3. **Check the Game Board Appearance:**

![Section 7 Checkpoint - New appearance](img/10.png)

- **Game Board:**
  - The guess slots should be larger (`h-16 w-16`) with bigger letters (`text-3xl`).
  - There should be a gap between each letter due to `gap-2`.
  - The color-coding for guesses should be more vibrant.

4. **Test the Guess Input:**

   - **Consistency:**
     - The input slots should match the styling of the guess slots.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Typing letters should fill the slots.
     - The input should automatically submit when all slots are filled.

5. **Test the On-Screen Keyboard:**

   - **Appearance:**
     - The keyboard should have larger keys (`!h-16`).
     - Keys should have consistent styling with the rest of the app.
   - **Functionality:**
     - Pressing keys should update the guess input.
     - The "enter" key should submit the guess when appropriate.

6. **Play Through a Game:**

   - **Make Guesses:**
     - Observe the enhanced feedback with the updated color scheme.
     - Ensure the guess input clears after each submission.

7. **Check the Game Over Dialog:**

   - **Winning:**
     ![Section 7 Checkpoint - Win Scenario](img/8.png)
     - Win the game to see the confetti animation.
     - The dialog should display a congratulatory message in large, bold text.
   - **Losing:**
     ![Section 7 Checkpoint - Lose Scenario](img/9.png)
     - Lose the game to see the encouraging message.
   - **Common Elements:**
     - The dialog should display all your guesses.
     - A "Play again!" button should be present and functional.

If everything works as expected, congratulations! You've successfully polished your Wordle clone.
